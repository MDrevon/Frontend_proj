# Rick and Morty Character Viewer

This is a web application that retrieves and displays characters from the **Rick and Morty API**.

## **How to use**
- Visit the application URL
- The page will load with a list of Rick and Morty characters.
- You can use the search bar to search for a specific character by their name.  Click on the "Search" button to retrieve the results.
- Click on a character image to view more details about the character in a modal window.
- Use the pagination buttons to navigate through the list of characters.

## **Technologies Used**
- HTML
- CSS (Bulma)
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- The Rick and Morty API

## **Installation**
- Clone the repository
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser

## **Code Overview**
- The `index.html` file contains the structure and layout of the web page
- The `index.js` file contains the JavaScript code that retrieves the data from the Rick and Morty API and manipilates the DOM to display the data on the web page.

## **Functionality**
The application retrieves data from the Rick and Morty API and displays the character's name and image in a tile format. When a user clicks on a character's image, a modal window opens up, displaying more information about the character, such as their name, species, status, gender, and list of episodes. The user can also search for a specific character using the search bar. Pagination is also implemented to navigate through the list of characters.

This project was developed to show my understanding of using AJAX to pull information from an API as well as dynamically generate web elements using jQuery.
